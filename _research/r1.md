The cost of adopting new technology is rarely analyzed and discussed, while it is vital for many software companies worldwide. Thus, it is crucial to consider Return On Investment (ROI) when performing data analytics. Decisions on "How much analytics is needed?" are hard to answer. ROI could guide decision support on the What?, How?, and How Much? analytics for a given problem. This work details a comprehensive tool that provides conventional and advanced ML approaches for demonstration using requirements dependency extraction and their ROI analysis as a use case. Utilizing advanced ML techniques such as Active Learning, Transfer Learning, and the primitive Large Language Model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as its various components for automating dependency extraction, the tool's outcomes demonstrate a mechanism to compute the ROI of ML algorithms, presenting a clear picture of the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of a technology investment.
