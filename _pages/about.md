<div>
I am a second-year MSc student in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, Canada. I completed my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jodhpur (India), earning a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Data Science.
<br/><br/>
My academic interests lie at the intersection of healthcare, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning, with a focus on building scalable, reliable and responsible AI systems for clinical data. I am motivated by the challenge of using data-driven methods to solve real-world problems in healthcare while ensuring privacy, safety, and ethical use of data. My background has equipped me with strong skills in problem-solving, analytical reasoning, algorithms, and statistical modeling.


<b>I like exploring ML algorithms and investigating the extent to which they can be made fair and bias-free.</b>

<b>My current areas of interest include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Clinical text de-identification and privacy-preserving NLP</li>
<li>Deep Learning for healthcare</li>
<li>Bias and Fairness in ML Algorithms</li>
<li>Applied ML and building scalable solutions</li>
</ul>

During my time as a student, I got opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain practical experience. Such opportunities included my role as a Data Science and Machine Learning intern. This experience allowed me to work on real-world projects, collaborating with a team to analyse and extract insights from large datasets. It was during these internships that I discovered my passion for using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to uncover patterns and make data-driven predictions. I am totally in for all the project involving Dev + ML!
<br/><br/>


I was awarded the <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship" target="_blank"> Mitacs Globalink Research Internship</a>, through which I was selected among students from 16 countries to undertake a summer research internship at the University of Calgary, Canada, further strengthening my research interests in applied machine learning.
