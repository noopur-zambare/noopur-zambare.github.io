<div>
I'm a final-year undergraduate student at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur (India)</a> pursuing Bachelorâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering with Specialisation in Data Science.
<br/><br/>
I have been captivated by the intersection of technology and engineering throughout my academic career. I believe the solution to today's complicated problems lies in harnessing the power of data and using it to encourage innovation. I have a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, thanks to my undergraduate journey which has allowed me to delve even further into the world of algorithms, data science, and predictive modelling.

<br/><br/>
As I approach the end of my undergraduate journey, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead. I hope to contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact on society while continuously learning and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
<br/><br/>

<b>My current areas of interest include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Deep Learning</li>
<li>Large Language Models</li>
<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
<li>NLP</li>
</ul>

During my time as a student, I got opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain practical experience. Such opportunities included my role as a Data Science and Machine Learning intern. This experience allowed me to work on real-world projects, collaborating with a team to analyse and extract insights from large datasets. It was during these internships that I discovered my passion for using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to uncover patterns and make data-driven predictions.
<br/><br/>

I was awarded the  <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship" target="_blank"> MITACS Globalink Research Internship</a> by MITACS Canada. I was chosen amongst students from 16 countries to undertake a summer internship at <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>.

<b>Coursework:</b>
    <p>These are the courses I have taken in my academic education, at workshops, internships, and extracurricular coursework in addition to self-study.</p>
