I'm a first-year MSc student in the Department of Computing Science at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html" target="_blank">University of Alberta, Canada</a>. I did my undergraduate from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur (India)</a> in a Bachelorâ€™s of Technology in Mechanical Engineering with a Specialisation in Data Science.
<br/><br/>
I have been captivated by the intersection of technology and engineering throughout my academic career. I believe the solution to today's complicated problems lies in harnessing the power of data and using it to encourage innovation. I have a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, thanks to my undergraduate journey which has allowed me to delve even further into the world of algorithms, data science, and predictive modelling.


<b>I like exploring ML algorithms and investigating the extent to which they can be made fair and bias-free.</b>

<b>My current areas of interest include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Deep Learning</li>
<li>Return on Investment for Machine Learning Algorithms</li>
</ul>

During my time as a student, I got opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain practical experience. Such opportunities included my role as a Data Science and Machine Learning intern. This experience allowed me to work on real-world projects, collaborating with a team to analyse and extract insights from large datasets. It was during these internships that I discovered my passion for using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to uncover patterns and make data-driven predictions. I am totally in for all the project involving Dev + ML!
<br/><br/>

I was awarded the  <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship" target="_blank"> MITACS Globalink Research Internship</a> by MITACS Canada. I was chosen amongst students from 16 countries to undertake a summer internship at the University of Calgary, Canada.
