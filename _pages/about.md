I have been captivated by the intersection of technology and engineering throughout my academic career. I believe the solution to today's complicated problems lies in harnessing the power of data and using it to encourage innovation. I have a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking thanks to my degree in Mechanical Engineering, and my Minor degree in Data Science has allowed me to delve even further into the world of algorithms, data science, and predictive modelling.

As I approach the end of my undergraduate journey, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead. I hope to contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact on society while continuously learning and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
