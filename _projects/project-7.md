### Framework for harnessing ML to create Wearable Medical Technology

- Carried out clinical studies with the goal of categorising mandibular motions during eating.
- Real-time sensor data acquisition and transmission enabled by the HC-05 Bluetooth Module.
- Compared computational eﬀiciencies of LNN and LSTM for sequential data.
