### Technique to detect biases in Distributed ML Algorithms

- Designed 5 clients and 5 agents system for distributed learning.
- Employed Differential Privacy techniques to add noise to the aggregated model updates, ensuring privacy in Federated Learning.
- Fostered security in Swarm Learning using Decentralized Identity Management.
- Algorithm: Distributed Machine Learning
