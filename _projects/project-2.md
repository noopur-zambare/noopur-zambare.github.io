### ML framework for Text Classification using Meta-Learning with GAN

- Applied a cutting-edge Meta-Reinforcement Learning framework to substantially improve model performance and facilitate rapid adaptation to dynamically changing environments and tasks.
- Developed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, producing synthetic training samples.
- Architectured GAN consisted of a multi-layered generator and discriminator.
- Integrated Meta-Reinforcement GANs achieved an accuracy of 86%, compared to 75% for baseline models.
- Algorithms: Reinforcement Learning, Meta-Learning
