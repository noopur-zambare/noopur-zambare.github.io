### ML framework for Text Classification using Meta-Learning with GAN

- Applied a cutting-edge Meta-Learning framework to substantially improve model performance and facilitate rapid adaptation to dynamically changing environments and tasks.
-  Developed GAN for data augmentation consisting of a multi-layered generator and discriminator.address Catastrophic Forgetting during Meta-Learning.
- Achieved an accuracy of 95%, compared to 87% for baseline models.
- Algorithms: Reinforcement Learning, Meta-Learning
