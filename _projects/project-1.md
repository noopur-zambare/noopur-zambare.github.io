### A decision-making algorithm based on LNN - Bachelor’s Thesis 

- Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) as a novel approach to foster decision-making processes.
- LNNs, inspired by fluid dynamics, exhibit dynamic information flow and adaptability, enabling eﬀicient decision-making.
- Utilizing LNN to benefit Autonomous Driving Vehicles
