<h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new content, such as images, text, music, and even videos, that closely resemble what a human might create. Unlike traditional AI systems that analyze and make predictions based on existing data, generative AI goes a step further by generating novel data. In essence, it can produce new things, whether that’s writing a story, designing a piece of art, or composing a song—based on patterns and information it has learned from vast amounts of data. Some common examples include AI-generated art (like DALL.E), music composition, and natural language generation (like GPT models).

The core of generative AI is in its ability to generalise and innovate, allowing it to produce content that is original, while still being informed by real-world examples.
