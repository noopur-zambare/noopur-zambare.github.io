<h2>Getting Started with Generative AI</h2> Generative AI refers to models that can create new data. For example, a generative AI model can generate new images, music, or even text based on patterns it has learned from a large dataset. Some common examples include AI-generated art (like DALL·E), music composition, and natural language generation (like GPT models).


<h2>Try MacBook Air - 16 Neural Engines</h2>
If you prefer working on a local machine, the MacBook Air with Apple’s M1, M2, or M3 chip presents an impressive alternative for running machine learning tasks. Working with Apple’s ecosystem, the new integration of Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) with PyTorch brings significant improvements to training acceleration. Apple's Metal is a low-level, high-performance graphics API that lets programmers connect directly to the GPU. MPS are a special group of highly optimized compute kernels in the Metal framework that speed up tasks that need a lot of computing power, like machine learning. The MPS framework is designed to work with Apple's GPUs, which allows you to fine-tune speed for image processing, machine learning tasks, and other scientific computing tasks.
