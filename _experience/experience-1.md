In my ongoing role as an Undergraduate Researcher at the University of Calgary,  my primary research focus revolves around the project titled "Tiny and Robust ML." Within this project, I am actively involved in developing an algorithm aimed at compacting neural networks with early exit features, showcasing improved accuracy and efficiency in various classification tasks. Additionally, I incorporate fairness and biasness evaluation methodologies to ensure the ethical and equitable deployment of machine learning models. My research leverages a technical stack comprising Liquid Neural Network, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, underscoring my commitment to advancing both the efficiency and fairness aspects of machine learning algorithms.
